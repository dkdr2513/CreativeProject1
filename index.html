The next paragraphs become the supporting evidence for your thesis. This is where you include the statistics, opinions of experts, and anecdotal information.

Compose a closing paragraph that is basically a reiteration of your thesis statement with new assertions or conclusive findings you find during with your research.

Lastly, go back to your introductory hook paragraph. Can you use a quote, shocking fact, or paint a picture of the thesis statement using an anecdote? This is how you sink your hooks into a reader.

The best part is if you are not loving what you come up with at first, then you can play around with the introduction. Find several facts or quotes that might work for you. Try out a few different starting sentences and determine which of your choices makes the most interesting beginning to your essay.
    <br>
    <br>Once you have selected a topic you feel strongly about, make a list of points for both sides of the argument. When shaping an argument you'll have to explain why your belief is reasonable and logical, so list points you can use as evidence for or against an issue. Ultimately, determine your side of the argument and make sure you can back up your point of view with reasoning and evidence. Work against the opposing point of view and prove why your stance is correct.<br><br>
    Although the essay is about your opinion, you have to back up your claimsâ€”factual statements will always be more impactful than pure opinion or vague comments. As you research your topic, look for information that will act as sound evidence for why your position is "right." Then, sprinkle factoids throughout your opinion paper to reinforce your point of view.

Your supporting statements should match the type of composition you're writing, e.g. general observations for a letter to the editor and credible statistics for a research paper. Anecdotes from individuals involved in the issue can also provide a human aspect to your argument.
